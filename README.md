Quicksi is a command line tool with reuseable starters in different languages, frameworks and libraries designed to make it easy for developers to start projects without having to worry about the setup.

### Goal of Quicksi

Getting a new project up and running can be time consuming and demotivating when what you really want is to just work on your idea. It can take hours/days to get through all the boilerplate before you can get to any actual work.

The goal of Quicksi is to give you a strong, modern project with just a few commands so you can begin writing your application from the start and not worry about the boilerplate or the whole starting process.

## Quick start
To get the latest version of quick


```
npx quicksi
```


> If you've previously installed quicksi globally via npm install -g quicksi, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g quicksi to ensure that npx always uses the latest version. Or see the other installations below if you want to install globally.


## Install globally
To install `quicksi` on your local machine, run:

```
npm i -g quicksi
```
or

```
yarn global add quicksi
```

<br/>
Installing quicksi globally gives you access to one command alone:

```
quicksi
```

<br/>
But you'll have to check for new versions of quicksi and update the package.

```
npm update -g quicksi
```
